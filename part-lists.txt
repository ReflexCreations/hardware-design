NOTE: Motedis parts are only sourcable in the UK/EU. They will not be added to your basket if you select another country. 
This basket can be used as a reference for sourcing parts in alternate countries. I would suggest looking for aluminium profile/extrusion websites. 8020 being the most popular.
