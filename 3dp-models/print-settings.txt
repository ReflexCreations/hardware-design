Most of the parts have been designed to be strong at most default printer settings. I'll leave it up to the individuals doing the 3D printing right now to experiment with what they would like. But I'd suggest in specific, the 'sensor to panel adapter' parts should be printed with as thick a wall thickness as possible, and 100% infill. I believe they're strong enough without these settings but previous generations broke under high pressure (though they were significantly less well designed). If something does break, please let me know, as it'd warrant a re-design.
