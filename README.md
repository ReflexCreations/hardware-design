# RE:Flex Dance Pad Hardware Designs
This repository contains source documents and manufacturing files for the RE:Flex Dance Pad's mechanical parts. It was created using [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/). However, future versions will be built with FreeCAD, due to Fusion's new pricing plan.

In this repository you will find:
- Fusion 360 source archives for the v1 (deprecated, and non-final) and v2 dance pads. These archives can be used to act as a reference model of RE:Flex Dance Pads, and future revisions.
- A folder of parts to be 3D printed in PLA.
- Parts lists for building a pad, bar, and doubles connectors. Currently this only lists the European vendor 'Motedis' parts for the base frame. It can be replicated with similar parts from 8020 and other vendors.

## Getting your own
